        # Determines the inheritance behavior for this `Policy`. By default, a `
        # ListPolicy` set at a resource supersedes any `Policy` set anywhere up the
        # resource hierarchy. However, if `inherit_from_parent` is set to `true`, then
        # the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent resource are inherited,
        # meaning the values set in this `Policy` are added to the values inherited up
        # the hierarchy. Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values
        # and denied values isn't recommended in most circumstances to keep the
        # configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `
        # Policy` with `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values`
        # set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values`
        # and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a `
        # Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type`
        # of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose
        # that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the
        # allowed API activations to ``E1`, `E2``. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a
        # project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false`
        # and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be
        # denied. The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `
        # projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values):
        # `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: `allowed_values: "E1"
        # allowed_values:"E2"` `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and
        # values: `allowed_values: "E3" allowed_values: "E4"` The accepted values at `
        # organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `
        # E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy`
        # with values: `allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values:"E2"` `projects/bar` has a `
        # Policy` with values: `value: "E3" value: "E4" inherit_from_parent: true` The
        # accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `
        # projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both
        # allowed and denied values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: `
        # allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"` `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
        # `denied_values: "E1"` The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`
        # . The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`. Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `
        # organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: `allowed_values: "E1"
        # allowed_values:"E2"` `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: `
        # RestoreDefault: ``` The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.
        # The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the
        # value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (
        # no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set. `
        # projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are
        # either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`,
        # all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations/
        # foo` has a `Policy` with values: `allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"` `
        # projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: `all: ALLOW` The accepted values at `
        # organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at `projects/bar`.
        # Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy`
        # with values: `allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"` `projects/bar` has a `
        # Policy` with: `all: DENY` The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`,
        # E2`. No value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 10 (allowed and denied
        # subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource
        # hierarchy O1->`F1, F2`; F1->`P1`; F2->`P2, P3`, `organizations/foo` has a `
        # Policy` with values: `allowed_values: "under:organizations/O1"` `projects/bar`
        # has a `Policy` with: `allowed_values: "under:projects/P3"` `denied_values: "
        # under:folders/F2"` The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `
        # organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`, `projects/P2`, `
        # projects/P3`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `organizations/O1`, `
